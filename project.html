The Star Wars Problem:
I would buy key words such as role playing game toys, galaxy wars, space action figures, RPG collectables
I would pay the website that does online role-playing to put ads for my website to hopefully gain some revenue.  Any money I have left I would use it to buy advertising space on kid friendly websites.
Make sure ads on role playing sites are strictly called collectables whereas kids advertisements are refered to as toys
70% of my funds goes towards purshacing key words
15% would go towards advertisments
15% would be used for any website maintence

Business Model Plan
Key Partners: 
    Toy companies, kid friendly websites, role-playing websites

    Supply costumers with star wars products
Customer relationships:

Cost Structure:

    Our revenue would come from the products we sell
Costumer Segments: 
    Children who like star wars, older individuals who have an interest in classic star wars
